# Item contributions
Contribute to assigning to each vanilla item a custom rarity.
## Valid rarities
The valid rarities are the following: `COMMON`, `UNCOMMON`, `RARE`, `EPIC`, `LEGENDARY`, `SPECIAL`. If a item has no rarity specified to it, it will be `COMMON` by default. The `SPECIAL` rarity is reserved for items like the Debug Stick, Command Blocks, End Frames, etc.
## Valid materials
You can get a list of valid materials in Minecraft 1.16.5 from [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html)
