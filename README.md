# Item contributions
Contribute to assigning to each vanilla item a custom rarity.
## Valid rarities
The valid rarities are the following: `COMMON`, `UNCOMMON`, `RARE`, `EPIC`, `LEGENDARY`, `SPECIAL`. If a item has no rarity specified to it, it will be `COMMON` by default. The `SPECIAL` rarity is reserved for items like the Debug Stick, Command Blocks, End Frames, etc.
## Valid materials
You can get a list of valid materials in Minecraft 1.16.5 from [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html)
## Contributing to attributes
If you feel that an attribute specified in one of the files is not balanced, incorrect or it's not defined, feel free to change it as long as the changes made make sense. 
The attributes that we currently use are: `damage`, `attack_speed`, `health`, `defense`, `cooldown` and `feeds`. The `feeds` attribute is reserved for the amount of hunger that a comestible item removes in the hunger bar at the bottom of the screen.
